## **A Python web scraper for creating wordlists similiar to tools like Cewl.**

----------

### ***One is a simple script to crawl one web page for all the words over a specific length***

----------

### ***Two is a more advanced way to gather words. It collects the words on the original page, as well as the links. It adds those links to a list, and crawls them as well. The user sets depth level at start of the script. Be careful going over 3-4. This will take a long time to run, and if you crawl a blog or the like relative to your target you can easily grab 100k good words in one hour.***
